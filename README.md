Promotional and market based website

# Purpose
  Create an online space where a client could promote themselves and their skill or serviced while also having a place for a small buisness. A user will be able to view the site and get an idea of who the client is as a person and their range of skills. The site will be heavy on the user interface aspects as it is trying to sell the client to the user and it is imperitive that the user has a fluid and enjoyable time exploring the site. A small store will be available, complete with cart functionality. User sign in and log in features will expose personalizerd aspects to the user to endear them to the client. Access to the store will become available after a user signs up with the client. Users will be directed to contact the client through email forms to hopefully begin talks on future projects.
