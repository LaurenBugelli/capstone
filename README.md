Promotional and market based website

# Purpose
  Create an online space where a client could promote themselves and their skill or services while also having a place for a small buisness. A user will be able to view the site and become aquainted with the client and their skillset. The site will focus on user interface with the intention of marketing the client to the user. It is imperative that the user has a fluid and enjoyable experience exploring the site. A small store will be available, complete with cart functionality. /*User sign in and log in features will expose personalizerd aspects to the user to endear them to the client*/. Access to the store will become available after a user signs up with the client. Users will be directed to contact the client through email forms to encourage comunication on potential projects.
  
# Tasks
  I've broken this project up into three main catagories to complete over the 2020 fall semester. Since the semester was shortened, there are several tentative features that are planned, but may not be implemented into the final product. Each task will include aspects of HTML, Js, and php.
  
# Task 1: First Impressions
  Interactive and responsive Home Page. As this is the first page the user will see, professionalism and a clean product are, the goals for this task.

  # Task 2: UI and Backend Functionality
  Once the sign in/ log in functionality works, a tentative task is to implement personalized messages to the user. The overall goal of this task is to hook the user on the client's fishing line. These tasks will be used to endear the user to the client or spark interest in them for the client.

  # Task 3: Clean Up
  The store functionality will have a completed cart but will NOT have the ability to connect to anyone's finances.

Another tentative task will be to try and make all my pages responsive, not only on a desktop, but on a mobile device as well.
